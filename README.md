# Fiddler
The aim of this Chrome Browser Extension is to allow users to download their fiddles from JSFiddle as a complete project. It's taken about a month to get as far as I have, and I figure it may as well be open source. This way, if people see room and opportunity for improvement, they can go for it. I'm happy to say that I had wanted something like this when I first started playing with javascript a few years back, and now I've made it for anyone that's had a similar journey into the field of web development. 

It certainly stands some improvement, and will be placed on the webstore soon. Name may or may not change depending on what extensions are available there already. 

Current Version: 0.1
